**Be there for every keystroke**

Some of us, at least some of the time, want to understand our code at a deep
level. For that, handing a task to an agent and reviewing the diff that comes
back can be exhausting. With *AI Pair*, you're there for every keystroke
instead, and you end up knowing the code almost as if you'd typed it yourself.

It's pair programming where your coding agent has the keyboard. It types in
your editor slowly enough to follow and explains what it's doing. Interrupt it
whenever you like, or take over and let it watch you for a change.

**Interrupt and steer**

**Watch it change its mind in real time**

It's also a good way to learn a new technology, or to have the agent walk you
through code you don't know yet.

**Ask it to explain code line by line**

It works in VS Code, with the coding agent you already use. Setup is built in
for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor and GitHub Copilot, and
any agent that supports MCP can be connected by hand.

**Note:** It works best with strong models; weaker ones tend to struggle with
this way of working.

## Set up

1. Open a project folder.
2. Run **AI Pair: Set Up Agent** and pick your agents: Claude Code, Codex,
   OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor. It adds a `pair` server to each one's
   user-wide MCP configuration. **Another agent** copies an MCP configuration
   instead: a stdio server named `pair` running `~/.ai-pair/bin/pair-mcp`
   (`pair-mcp.cmd` on Windows).
   GitHub Copilot needs no setup.
3. Restart your agent.

## Pair

Start your agent in the folder that's open in VS Code and ask it to pair ("let's
pair on..."). In Claude Code you can also run `/mcp__pair__start`.

- **Reply:** type in the panel's reply box and press Enter. Typing pauses
  playback.
- **Ask about some code:** select it in the editor, then reply; the selection
  goes along (**x** leaves it out). Or right-click it: *Ask the Agent About the
  Selection*.
- **Commands:** the agent's tests and builds play in an *AI Pair* terminal.
  Choose **Run**, **Allow for session**, or **Skip** in the panel.
- **Interrupt:** the button, or just edit the code.
- **Look around:** scrolling or switching files pauses playback. **Resume**
  brings you back.
- **My turn / Hand back:** write a part yourself while the agent navigates.
- **The speed menu (1.0x):** the pace, from 0.4x to 3.0x.
- **The reading menu (read 1.0x):** the pause after each message, from 0.4x
  to 3.0x.
- **AI Pair: Calibrate Reading Speed** times you on a passage and sets the
  pause after each message to your own pace.

**AI Pair: Play Demo Session** shows what it's like without an agent.

## Settings

- `aiPair.speed`: overall playback speed.
- `aiPair.readingSpeed`: reading speed, for the pause after each message.
- `aiPair.calibrationPassage`: the passage the calibration times you on; empty, the
  built-in one.
- `aiPair.agentName`: the name on the agent's cursor.
- `aiPair.timing`: fine-tune any typing or pause duration.
- `aiPair.confirmCommands`: ask before each command the agent runs in the
  terminal (on by default).
