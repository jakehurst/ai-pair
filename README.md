**Be there for every keystroke**

Some of us, at least some of the time, want to understand our code at a deep
level. For that, handing a task to an agent and reviewing the diff that comes
back can be exhausting. With *AI Pair Programmer*, you're there for every
keystroke instead, and you end up knowing the code almost as if you'd typed it
yourself.

It's pair programming where your coding agent has the keyboard. It types in
your editor slowly enough to follow and explains what it's doing. Interrupt it
whenever you like, or take over and let it watch you for a change.

**Interrupt and steer**

**Watch it change its mind in real time**

![The agent writes a comment, reconsiders, deletes it, and documents the type differently](media/change-its-mind.gif)

It's also a good way to learn a new technology, or to have the agent walk you
through code you don't know yet.

**Ask it to explain code line by line**

It works in VS Code, with the coding agent you already use. Setup is built in
for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor and GitHub Copilot, and
any agent that supports MCP can be connected by hand.

**Note:** It works best with strong models; weaker ones tend to struggle with
this way of working.

## How to use it

Once the extension is [installed](#install) and
[connected to your agent](#connect-your-agent), keep using your agent as usual.
When you want to pair:

1. Open the project in VS Code, and start your agent **in the same folder** (or
   a subfolder of it).
2. Ask it to pair: *"Let's pair on adding a settings page."* In Claude Code,
   you can also run `/mcp__pair__start`. If you want to learn the technology
   too, say so: *"…I'm new to Svelte, explain as you go."*
3. The **Pair** panel opens in the secondary side bar, and the agent's cursor
   appears in your editor.

Anything you say or edit interrupts the agent, so its next move takes it into
account. While you pair:

| To… | Do this |
|---|---|
| say something to the agent | type in the reply box, press Enter. Typing pauses playback. |
| ask about some code | select it in the editor, then reply: the selection goes along (× leaves it out) |
| let it run a command | the agent's tests and builds play in an *AI Pair* terminal; **Run**, **Allow for session**, or **Skip** in the panel |
| stop it right now | **Interrupt**, or just edit the code: any edit interrupts |
| look around | scroll or switch files. Playback pauses until you **Resume**, which brings you back to the agent's cursor |
| write a part yourself | **My turn**. The agent becomes the navigator and comments as you type. **Hand back** returns the turn, with your reply if you typed one |
| change the pace | the speed menu (**1.0×**), from 0.4× to 3.0× |
| finish | **End**, or tell the agent you're done. You can pair again anytime |

The cursor's color tells you what the agent is doing. It's yellow and pulsing
when it's just said something and is waiting for you to read it.

**Try it without an agent:** *AI Pair: Play Demo Session* plays a scripted
session that adds a small API to an Express app, which it creates in
`ai-pair-demo/`.

## How it works under the hood

```
agent (Claude Code, …) ── stdio MCP ──▶ pair-mcp ── local WebSocket ──▶ VS Code extension
```

The agent submits small batches of actions: say, move, select, type, delete,
point, run. The extension plays them at a human pace and reports back exactly
what happened, including everything you did in the meantime. The agent plans
its next batch while you watch the current one, which hides most of its
thinking time. And it's never more than one batch ahead, so your interruptions
land immediately.

The design is written up in:

- [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md): the tools and their exact semantics, as the agent sees them.
- [AGENT_GUIDE.md](AGENT_GUIDE.md): how the agent should pair, returned to it when a session starts.
- [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md): what you see: the cursor, the panel, the timing.
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md): the components and how they connect.

## Install

You need **VS Code 1.105 or newer**. Install **AI Pair** from the
[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michalstrba.ai-pair): in the
Extensions view, search for `@id:michalstrba.ai-pair`, or run:

```sh
code --install-extension michalstrba.ai-pair
```

To build it from source instead, you also need **Node.js 20 or newer**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/faiface/ai-pair.git
cd ai-pair
npm install
npm run package
code --install-extension ai-pair-*.vsix
```

## Connect your agent

1. **Open a project folder in VS Code.** The extension installs the MCP server
   your agent runs, at `~/.ai-pair/bin/pair-mcp`
   (`%USERPROFILE%\.ai-pair\bin\pair-mcp.cmd` on Windows). It runs on
   VS Code's own runtime, so it doesn't need Node.js.
2. **Run *AI Pair: Set Up Agent*** from the command palette (VS Code also
   offers this the first time the extension starts). Pick your agents; the
   ones it finds installed are already checked. For each one, it adds a
   server named `pair` to that agent's user-wide MCP configuration, leaving
   everything else in the file as it was:

   | Agent | Where |
   |---|---|
   | **Claude Code** (the CLI, the IDE extensions, the Claude desktop app's Code tab) | `claude mcp add --scope user`, or `~/.claude.json` without the `claude` command |
   | **Codex** (the CLI, the IDE extension, the app) | `~/.codex/config.toml` (or in `$CODEX_HOME`) |
   | **OpenCode** | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (`.jsonc` if you have one), on Windows too |
   | **Gemini CLI** | `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
   | **Cursor** | `~/.cursor/mcp.json` |
   | **Another agent** | copies an MCP server configuration to the clipboard: a stdio server named `pair` running the launcher |

   **GitHub Copilot** in VS Code needs none of this: the extension gives it
   the `pair` server itself.
3. **Restart your agent** so it picks up the new server.

## Settings

| Setting | |
|---|---|
| `aiPair.speed` | Overall playback speed (the panel's speed menu offers 0.4× to 3.0×). |
| `aiPair.agentName` | The name on the agent's cursor. |
| `aiPair.timing` | Fine-tune any typing or pause duration, e.g. `{ "afterSelectMs": 900, "type": { "wordStartMs": 140 } }`. Every key is in [`timing.ts`](packages/core/src/timing.ts). |
| `aiPair.confirmCommands` | Ask before each command the agent runs in the terminal (default on). Turned off, the agent's commands run without any prompt, not even its own. |

## Troubleshooting

- **The agent says `no_editor`.** Its working directory isn't inside a folder
  that's open in VS Code. Open that folder in VS Code, or start the agent in
  it.
- **The agent doesn't have the pair tools.** Restart the agent after setting
  it up. *AI Pair: Set Up Agent* marks the agents that are set up. With
  Claude Code, `claude mcp list` should show `pair`. With Copilot, `pair`
  should be in *MCP: List Servers*; start it there if it isn't running.
- **After updating the extension,** reload the VS Code window and restart the
  agent.

## Development

```
packages/
  protocol/   types shared by everything
  core/       editor-agnostic sessions, playback, and the local WebSocket server
  relay/      pair-mcp, the MCP server the agent runs
  vscode/     the extension, which ships the relay
```

```sh
npm install
npm test                  # unit and end-to-end tests
npm run typecheck
npm run build             # development build of the extension
npm run test:integration  # plays a session inside a real, isolated VS Code (macOS; VSCODE_BIN for another)
npm run test:coverage     # the unit tests, with coverage
npm run package           # production build → ai-pair-<version>.vsix
```

To run your working copy, open the repository in VS Code and press F5, or:

```sh
code --extensionDevelopmentPath="$PWD/packages/vscode" <a project folder>
```

### Releasing

Add a section for the new version to
[`packages/vscode/CHANGELOG.md`](packages/vscode/CHANGELOG.md), then, on an
up-to-date `main`:

```sh
npm run release -- patch   # or minor, major, or an exact version
```

It runs every test, bumps the version, builds the `.vsix` once and publishes
that file to the Marketplace, then commits, tags and pushes the release and
makes a GitHub release with the `.vsix` attached. It asks before publishing,
since a version can't be published twice. It needs `vsce login michalstrba` and
`gh auth login` done once.
