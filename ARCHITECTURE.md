# Architecture

The components of the tool, how they find and talk to each other, and how a
pairing session starts and ends. The agent-facing contract is in
[PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md); the programmer-facing design is in
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

Status: **draft**.

```

- **`pair-mcp`** is the MCP server the harness launches over stdio. It holds the
  tool schemas, the server instructions, and the `start` prompt, forwards
  every tool call to the extension, and renders the extension's structured
  reports as the text the agent reads. It has no session state of its own.
- **The core** is an editor-agnostic TypeScript library, running inside the
  extension: sessions, the batch queue, the playback scheduler, place
  resolution, cursor tracking, the event log, and report assembly. It has no
  editor dependencies, so it can be tested against a fake editor.
- **The VS Code adapter** is a thin layer over the VS Code API: apply edits with
  undo stops, report document changes, render decorations, scroll, save. It
  tells the agent's edits apart from the programmer's by tracking the document
  versions its own edits produce.
- **The narration panel** is a webview. It talks to the extension via
  `postMessage`, with the messages typed in
  [`panelMessages.ts`](packages/vscode/src/panelMessages.ts). Its markup is
  [`panelHtml.ts`](packages/vscode/src/panelHtml.ts), and its script is
  [`webview/panel.ts`](packages/vscode/src/webview/panel.ts), bundled as
  `dist/panel.js`.

### Why a relay

Every harness supports stdio MCP servers, and a stdio config is static: "run
this command". If the extension served MCP over HTTP directly, the harness
would need a URL whose port changes with every VS Code window. The relay keeps
the harness config fixed and resolves which editor to talk to at runtime.

### Why the core runs inside the extension

It's simpler, and playback timing stays next to the editor. The core could
later become a separate process with thin editor clients (like a language
server with document sync), which may be needed for Zed. That move wouldn't
change the protocol.

## Discovery and connection

**Each VS Code window registers itself.** On activation, the extension starts a
WebSocket server on a random port bound to `127.0.0.1`, and writes a discovery
file:

```jsonc
// ~/.ai-pair/windows/<pid>.json   (mode 0600)
{
  "pid": 41234,
  "workspaceFolders": ["/Users/me/projects/todo-app"],
  "port": 53817,
  "token": "…",               // random, per window
  "protocolVersion": 1,
  "lastFocused": 1758700000   // updated when the window gains focus
}
```

The file is removed on deactivation.

**The relay finds its window lazily**, when a session starts, not at launch. The
editor may be opened after the harness. To find the window it:

1. Reads all discovery files and drops stale ones (the process is gone).
2. Finds the agent's working directory: the first of these that a window's
   workspace folder contains. Harnesses don't all start MCP servers in the
   project (Codex's app and IDE extension start them in `/` or in their own
   install folder), so the relay's own working directory comes last:
   - the `cwd` the agent passes to `start`,
   - the harness's roots, if it supports MCP roots,
   - the relay's working directory.
3. Picks the window whose workspace folder contains it (the longest match). On
   a tie, it picks the most recently focused.
4. Connects and authenticates with the token and protocol version.

If no window matches, `start` fails with a clear message: "Open
`/Users/me/projects/todo-app` in VS Code with the extension installed."

**Relay ↔ extension messages** are JSON-RPC over the WebSocket, mirroring the
MCP tool calls one to one:

- `hello { token, protocolVersion }`: the handshake, rejected on a mismatch.
- `call { id, tool, args }` → `result { id, … }` or `error { id, … }`.
- `cancel { id }`: forwarded when the harness cancels a tool call, for example
  when the programmer presses Esc in the harness.
- `return { report }`: a report that arrived for a call the relay had already
  cancelled, handed back to be delivered again (see below).

**Cancelling a call doesn't affect the session.** A cancelled `step` has
already queued its batch, and its outcome is reported on the next call.
Cancellation just releases the blocked call, without taking a report.

**Reports survive a race with cancellation.** A cancellation takes a moment to
reach the editor. If the call returns in that moment (say, because the
programmer just wrote a message), the harness has already given up on it and
the report would be lost. So the relay sends such a report back, and the
editor puts its batches and events back to be reported again. The WebSocket is
ordered, so this happens before the agent's next call arrives.

**Paths are relative to the agent's working directory.** The relay sends the
working directory it found with `start`, and the session resolves and reports
paths relative to it, which may be a subfolder of the workspace.

## Sessions

**One MCP connection can host many pairing sessions, one after another.** The
programmer works in the harness as usual, starts pairing when they want to,
ends it, goes back to the harness, and may pair again later.

A **session**:

- **starts** when the agent calls `start`, typically because the programmer
  asked it to pair, or ran the `start` prompt. The panel opens.
- **ends** when:
  - the programmer presses End session in the panel, or
  - the agent calls `end` (e.g. the programmer said they're done), or
  - the relay disconnects (the harness exited), or
  - the window closes.
- **belongs to one window**, and a window has at most one session at a time. A
  `start` while another session is active in that window is rejected.

Outside a session, pair tools other than `start` fail with `no_session`, so an
agent can't accidentally drive the editor when the programmer isn't pairing.
The programmer's edits between sessions aren't tracked. A new session starts
fresh, and the agent should re-read what it needs.

The panel keeps each session's narration history. Between sessions it shows
"No active session", and how to start one.

## Starting a session

**First-time setup.** The command *AI Pair: Set up agent* registers `pair-mcp`
with the harnesses the programmer picks, in each one's user-wide MCP
configuration, so it works in every project. It edits only the `pair` entry,
keeping the rest of the file as it was: JSON and JSONC with `jsonc-parser`,
Codex's TOML as text, table by table (a TOML round trip would drop comments).
For Claude Code it runs `claude mcp add --scope user` when the `claude` command
is there, since Claude Code rewrites `~/.claude.json` constantly. Harnesses in
VS Code itself (Copilot) need no setup: the extension provides the server to
them through VS Code's MCP API, running the relay directly in the workspace.
For any other harness it copies the config snippet to the clipboard. The
extension offers this once, the first time it starts. The harnesses and their
files are in [`agents.ts`](packages/vscode/src/agents.ts).

**Each session.** The programmer asks the agent to pair ("let's pair on adding
a todos API, I'm new to Express"), or runs the server's `start` prompt (in
Claude Code: `/mcp__pair__start`). The agent calls `start`, which returns the
[agent guide](AGENT_GUIDE.md) along with the first report.

**Later, from the editor.** Starting from the editor (type the task in the
panel, and the extension launches the harness in the integrated terminal)
would be a convenience on top, with a small adapter per harness. Not in v1.

## Distribution

`pair-mcp` is **bundled inside the extension**, not published separately, so
the relay and the extension can never be out of sync.

The extension's install path changes with every version, so on activation the
extension writes a launcher at a fixed path, `~/.ai-pair/bin/pair-mcp`
(`pair-mcp.cmd` on Windows), pointing at the current version. The launcher runs
the relay with VS Code's own runtime (`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`), so the
programmer doesn't need Node installed.

## Repository layout

```
packages/
  protocol/   types of the agent protocol and the relay ↔ editor messages
  core/       editor-agnostic session and playback logic, and the WebSocket
              server (bridge) with discovery
  relay/      pair-mcp: stdio MCP ↔ WebSocket; tool schemas, instructions,
              the start prompt; bundles AGENT_GUIDE.md at build time
  vscode/     the extension: adapter, panel, launcher, setup; ships the relay
```

TypeScript throughout, npm workspaces, bundled with esbuild. The relay uses
the official MCP TypeScript SDK.

## Out of scope for v1

- **Permission prompts.** When the harness asks for permission, it notifies the
  programmer itself.
- **Starting from the editor** (see above).
- **Multiple agents** in one window.
- **Zed.**
